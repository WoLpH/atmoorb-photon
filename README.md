AtmoOrb Particle Photon 
=======================

This library is a fork of the NeoPixel library with an example for the AtmoOrb
since that appears to be the easiest way to have a fully functioning example on
Particle Build site.

Any and all help and improvements are welcome so feel free to fork and improve.
